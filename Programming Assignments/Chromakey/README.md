Description:
This programming assignment asks to perform a green-screen or chroma key operation. An input image (e.g. Stephen Colbert) is given with a green background. First, you will identify which parts of that image form the foreground (the mask) and which are the background (the key). You will replace the chroma key portion of the image with the corresponding portions of a new background image (e.g. USC campus). This technique is frequently used in the TV, movie, and digital imaging industries.
