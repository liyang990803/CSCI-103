CSCI 103 Zombies Programming Assignment Name: Yang LiEmail Address: yli546@usc.eduNOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, whichmay include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.If none, say "none".:================================ Questions ==================================1. Which kind of a loop did you use to iterate through the nights of a   single simulation?  Why?   :  I use a while loop because the number of people turned into zombies is undefined but I know the termination condition for this loop is when N equals to k. Therefore, using a while loop instead of a for loop would be a more appropriate choice here. 2. Which kind of a loop did you use to perform the M simulations? Why?:  I use a for loop because the number of iterations, which is M in this case, is defined. With respect to a fixed number of iterations, using a for loop instead of a while loop would be a more appropriate choice here. 3. How did you ensure that if a human was turned into a zombie on a   particular night that he/she didn't bite anyone until the following   night?:  I create a new array named ‘pop[new_zombie]’ to simulate if for every night zombies have bitten humans or not. It will include the latest number of zombies after one iteration.4. Experiment briefly running your program with fewer simulations    (smaller M value). One thing computer scientists do often is evaluate    trade-offs. Running with a smaller M results in some interesting    trade-offs: your program output three values, Average Nights, Max Nights    and Min Nights. How will these values be impacted by running fewer    simulations? On the other hand, what other property of your program is    affected by using a smaller M?:  I notice that, while I try with fewer and fewer simulations, the number of maximum nights decreases, the number of minimum nights increases, and the number of average nights do not really change too much. During the process of using fewer and fewer simulations, the precision of average nights and the time of execution have also been changed. 5. (Optional Challenge -- Ungraded)    You do not need to submit an answer if you prefer not to.)    Given a population of N and k initial zombies, can you find an expression   for the theoretical minimum number of nights it would take for everyone   to become a zombie?:================================ Remarks ====================================Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?: 3 hours.Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful toknow if you turned it in incomplete.: Dealing with the situation that humans turned into zombies take a little amount of time, but I figure it out soon by creating a new array named ‘pop[new_zombie]’.Do you have any other remarks?: N/A.
