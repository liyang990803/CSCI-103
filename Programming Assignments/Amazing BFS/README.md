Description:
This programming assignment asks to write a program to read a given maze (provided as text "art") and find the shortest path from start to finish. Mazes go back to antiquity and the story of the minotaur. However, Theseus didn't have Google Maps.

Specifically, the assignment will implement breadth-first search, a simple algorithm that finds not just any path to the exit in a maze, but actually finds the shortest path from the start to the finish. This algorithm was invented in the late 1950s, making it one of the earliest nontrivial algorithms to follow the creation of the electronic computer.
