# CSCI-599 

"Recently, many AI-related problems have seen great improvements â€“ for example, from image search,
to machine translation, to self-driving, and to medical applications. Our goal is to guide students to get
familiar with these recent cutting-edge deep learning (DL) advances in computer vision, natural language
processing, and robotics. Through this course, students will gain a basic understanding of DL algorithms,
and how to setup and solve problems involving deep learning techniques. The course will include a
couple of practical assignments and a final course project. For the final course project, students will be
encouraged to pick their own topics, but can also select from a provided list of projects."

This repository contains all the notebooks and course materials during this course, including but not limited to assignments, final project, and lectures.
