# HW4 Tests

## General

1. Copy the entire `hw4-tests` into your `hw4` folder.
2. Navigate into the `hw4-tests` folder in your `hw4` folder.
3. Type `make` to run the tests.

## Side Notes

1. You can run tests without valgrind by running `make test`.
2. You can turn off intermediate file deletion by opening the script and changing websearch_remove_files to 0. This will make generating the stress-data files much faster, but will take lots of space.
