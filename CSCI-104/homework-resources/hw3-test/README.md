## Problem 4 Stack (10%)

### Running the Tests

After setting all appropriate information in grading script, use the command `python hw3-checker.py` to run the tests. Result would be stored in `stack_results.txt` and `stack_valgrind.txt`

### Point Distribution

The test for this problem consists of 10 regular test cases, each of __1%__. We use GTEST to test the functionality. 

We used 3 runtime test (11-13), we use them to deduct points if runtime doesn't fit requirement.

## Problem 5 String Parser (50%)

### Running the Tests

After setting all appropriate information in grading script, use the command `python hw3-checker.py` to run the tests. Result would be stored in `stringparser_results.txt` and `stringparser_valgrind.txt`

### Point Distribution 

The test for this problem consists of 40 test cases, each of __1%__. And __10%__ code review. 

1 - 20: Single operator evaluation
21 - 30: Malformed test cases
31 - 40: Integration test
