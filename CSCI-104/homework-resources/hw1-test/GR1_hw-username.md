### Disputes

If you wish to discuss any matters regarding your score on this assignment, please write it as a comment on this issue and assign your grader. Any and all discussions pertaining to your homework score **must** be done via comments on this issue.  Do not use email to discuss grading matters as they won't be considered part of the regrade process. All discussions will be done privately using this issue.

You have 7 days from the time this issue was posted to *raise* a dispute about any grading issues. Allow up to 48 hours for your grader to respond. If your grader cannot resolve the issue within 7 days, you must elevate the issue to one of the TAs (Hannes, Gozde, or Yeji) by assigning them to this issue or attending their office hours. If after an additional 7 days you are still unhappy with the grading result, you must elevate the issue to a professor within 3 days. The professors will have the final input. 

This means you have a maximum of 7 + 7 + 3 days to resolve all grading disputes, after which point all grades are final. 

You are expected to follow the _Grading Disputes_ policies outlined on the [assignments](http://bits.usc.edu/cs104/assignments) page.
