Problem 1 (Course Policies)
(a) 4
(b) 1,2,3,4
(c) 2,3,4,5
(d) none
(e) 2,4,5

Problem 2 (Git)
(a) 3
(b) 1,2
(c) 1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
    2. git log -p -3
(d) git will open the text editor in the system default setting, 
	and user needs to enter the message.
(e) git clone git@github.com:usc-csci104-spring2018/hw-yli546.git

Problem 4 (Recursion) 
1. The output would be 
1
2
3
4
5

This program prints the exactly same array with the input. And the call tree 
is shown in the "calltree.jpg" file attached in the hw1 folder.

2. If the min is larger than max, funcB would fail to terminate. 
When min is smaller than or equal to max, the program would always terminate 
in the condition that min equals to max. However, the program would never terminate 
when min is larger than max.

3. The output would be: 
a[min]
a[min + 1]
a[min + 2]
...
a[mid]
...
a[max]

because the program basically would print out the array from the element of 
the smallest index to the largest index. In other words, the program would 
basically print the exactly same array.
