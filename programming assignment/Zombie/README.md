Description:
In a population of N people of which k are initially zombies, how many nights are required before the entire population 
(all N people) become zombies if the following conditions hold:

1. Zombies only come out at night
2. Being bitten by a zombie turns a human into a zombie
3. Each zombie randomly chooses one person (zombie or human) from the population per night and bites them.  
(A zombie may bite another zombie but this has no effect, other than wasting that zombie's bite for that night).
4. On any given night, a zombie (being dumb) may even choose to bite itself which has no effect.
5. A human who is bitten during a particular night and thus becomes a zombie should not bite anyone on that same night. 
They must wait until the next night to start biting people.
